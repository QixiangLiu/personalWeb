      Lab's teacher: Slagle, Kurtis<br>
      In the class, I failed project2 and midterm test. Midterm test has a lot of information
      and principles. I am not good at remembering the content. THe professor is allowed to
      bring one note in test. We have one midterm and one final, 4 projects, and 7 labs. Labs
      are easy. Donot worry! The projects would become more and more hard than before projects.
      Also, the professor would become more and more strict with projects. Team collaboration is
      important. Fighting!

        Notes: First, the professor is a good teacher. He teaches students very good!
        His class total has three tests, including two midterm and one final. He has revive
        seesions. I think it is important for me because his tests are similar to review
        sessions basically (about 90%). Second, he will teach knowledge that is different
        from texbook. I do not know what the best way to solve problems. Third, his homeworks
        are more complicated than tests. <br>
        You can get a good grade simply in the class.<br>
        Most homeworks are from textbooks.

      My Class's Professor: Minden, Gary <br>
      <a href="http://www.ittc.ku.edu/~gminden/Computer_Architecture/" target="_blank">EECS645's website</a>
      <p>
        Note: Sleeping in class is OK, but donot play smartphones and chat. Most students
        usually do their own works.<br>
        The textbook of EECS645 is hard to understand. The textboos is pure theroems.
        The professor cannot teach too much useful knowledge. He just taught some
        information.<br>
        Homework questions are from ppt and textbooks. The first test questions are
        calculations.
