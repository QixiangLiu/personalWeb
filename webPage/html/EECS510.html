    <h3>Regular Grammar</h3>
    <pre>
      A third way of describing regular language is by means of certain grammars.
      right-linear grammar ----> regular language
      regular language     ----> right-linear grammar
      A grammar G=(V,T,S,P) that right-linear if <b>all</b> productions are of
                                                      A->xB,
                                                  Or  A->x,  A,B are vaiables.
      regular grammar is right-linear OR left-linear
      lift-linear ---> right-linear grammar: A->Bv ----> A->v<sup>R</sup>B
      A Pumping Lemma: Pigeonhole Principle: prove regular language that has DFA
      • If the transition graph has no cycles, the language is finite and therefore regular.
      • If the transition graph has a cycle with a nonempty label, the language is infinite. Conversely,
      every infinite regular language has a dfa with such a cycle.
      • If there is a cycle, this cycle can either be skipped or repeated an arbitrary number of times.
       So, if the cycle has label v and if the string w1vw2 is in the language.

    <h3>Context-free language</h3>
    <pre>
      1)leftmost/rightmost: each step the leftmost/rightmost variable replaced
      2)parse true/derivation:
      3)Simple grammar or s-grammar and forms A->ax, any pair (A,a) at most once;
      4)Properties: ambiguity(at least two distinct derivation trees), and unambiguous
      5)Programming language(BNF)
    </pre>
    <h3>Pushdown Automate</h3>
    <pre>
      1)NPDA: M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, z, F); first, change state, then replacment.
    </pre>
    <h3>Turing machine</h3>
    <pre>
      1)read-write head
      2）M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q0, □, F)；□ is blank; new state,a new type symbol,which replaced the old one,
      and a move symbol, L or R.
